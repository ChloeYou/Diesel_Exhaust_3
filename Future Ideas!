This is a list dedicated to the ideas that I think is cool but didn't have enough time/knowledge to work on. 
For those who are interested, feel free to pick it up from here: 

- use PBMC 9 individuals to study the intra-individual variance
- combine Anke's genetic risk score with DE3 
- Blood&NASAL&BRUSH sth like Rachel's BECon
- NASAL is just an interesting tissue to look at, cell deconvolution?
- http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=HRCA&u=ubcolumbia&id=GALE%7CA325307357&v=2.1&it=r&sid=summon only look at the CpGs associated with the genes involved in the asthma pathway
- tbc

Things I should do on the side: 
- add UCSC gene names to the volcano plots instead of CpG. (CpG sites will still printed in the console)
